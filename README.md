# PyChat-A-Simple-Yet-Robust-Python-Chat-Room

## Description:

PyChat is a Python-based chat room application that connects multiple clients (computers) through a centralized server. This project showcases the creation of a vibrant interactive experience with:

* **Client-to-client communication:** Users can send and receive messages from other connected clients in real-time, fostering community and interaction.
* **Multi-client support:** The server can handle multiple simultaneous connections, enabling group chats and a lively atmosphere.
* **Alias system:** Users choose unique aliases for identification within the chat room, adding a personal touch and facilitating message attribution.
* **Threading:** Separate threads handle message receiving and sending, ensuring smooth and responsive communication even with multiple clients.
* **Robust server management:** The server automatically accepts connections, assigns aliases, manages client list, and broadcasts messages effectively.

## Key Features:

* Simple and intuitive client-server architecture
* User-friendly command-line interface for clients
* Efficient multi-threading communication
* Automatic client management and alias assignment
* Secure connection using TCP/IP sockets

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3 (required).
3. Run the `server.py` script on one computer.
4. Run the `client.py` script on multiple computers, specifying the same server address (127.0.0.1:59000 by default).
5. Choose an alias and start chatting!
